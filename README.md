# Feed Reader Testing
___

This application uses the Jasmine testing framework to run tests against a single webpage that contains RSS feeds from the following websites:

1. [The Udacity Blog](https://blog.udacity.com/)
2. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
3. [HTML5 Rocks (now Web Fundamnetals)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/)
4. [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/)

In total, Jasmine runs four test suites and seven individual tests, which can all be found by scrolling to the bottom of the `index.html` page (see instructions on how to run the application locally, below).
